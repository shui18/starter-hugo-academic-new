abstract = {In this paper, a new dissipation-preserving scheme is established for weakly dissipative perturbations of oscillatory Hamiltonian systems. The system exhibits a nonlinear oscillatory structure. The main oscillation is governed by a matrix M and the damping is governed by a matrix Γ. The new scheme preserves the oscillatory structure of the systems by incorporating the matrix M in the scheme based on the idea of ERKN methods. Meanwhile, the discrete gradient and splitting are used to construct the scheme such that the numerical solution possesses a nearly correct damping rate of the system. A main feature of the new scheme is that a relatively large stepsize can be chosen since the convergence of the implicit iterations in the scheme is shown to be independent of the matrices M and Γ. Three numerical experiments of perturbed Hamiltonian systems are conducted to show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the new scheme in comparison with the traditional discrete gradient methods.}
